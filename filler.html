<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? &lt;strong&gt; I found what I need.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt; And it's not friends, it's things.&lt;/em&gt; Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;h2&gt;No! Don't jump!&lt;/h2&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Soon enough. Can we have Bender Burgers again? A true inspiration for the children. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Say what? We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Hello Morbo, how's the family? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I love you, buddy! Ask her how her day was. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. What are their names? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. I'm a thing. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Hello Morbo, how's the family? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! And until then, I can never die?&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Soon enough. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. No. We're on the top. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! We're rescuing ya. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Tell her she looks thin. When will that be? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
